# Intsallation

## 1. Set up
We just need to install two things, one is the text editor, one is the compiler.

## 2. Text editor
I think vim is the best, and this blog is written by vim.

## 3. The compiler 
```shell
sudo apt install gcc g++ clang 
```

This book seems to be based on the cc.( 
But I think the gcc is also OK
